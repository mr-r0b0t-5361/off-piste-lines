# Front-End Developer - Technical Task

Thanks for applying to work at FATMAP. We have developed this small task for you to work on in your own time so that we can see how you approach tasks and as a discussion point going forwards.

Try to spend less than two hours on this task - and don't worry if it is not complete, we prefer to see quality over quantity.

Please implement the task with React.

## The task

Using the off-pistes.json (this file contains the off-piste lines in Chamonix) file in this repo, build a front-end application that presents a list of off-piste lines to the user and does the following:

* Displays a list of off-piste lines and a summary.

* Allows sorting by ski_difficulty or name (defaults to name)

* **Bonus task** When a list item is clicked, the user is presented with an image of the off-piste line (hint: see geo_data field, the data is represented as [longitude, latitude, elevation] - elevation can be ignored)

### Notes

* A server is not needed for this task.

* Please create documentation for the steps required to run the project.
